## Protective Measures Against Coronavirus
Regardless of what situation you are currently in, the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend some basic protective measures in order to mitigate the spread of coronavirus in your community:

### 1. Wash your hands frequently
The WHO recommends that you regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with soap and water (or alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water are not immediately available); this kills viruses that may be on your hands. The CDC has a [guide](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/hand/handwashing.html) for proper hand-washing technique on its website, as well as [scientific justification](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-handwashing.html) for this technique! It is especially important that you wash your hands
* Before, during, and after preparing food
* Before eating food
* Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea
* Before and after treating a cut or wound
* After using the toilet
* After [changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/diapering/index.html)
* After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
* After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste
* After handling pet food or pet treats
* After touching garbage.

### 2. Maintain Social Distancing
The CDC recommends that you maintain at least a 6-foot distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing in order to avoid potential transmission. In the same vein, the CDC also recommends avoiding public gatherings where this distance cannot be maintained, especially groups of large people.

The lack of physical interaction can be a very challenging aspect of social distancing for many of us. It’s important to remember that in-person interaction is still possible, as long as proper social distancing is maintained! Otherwise, online platforms such as Google Hangouts or Facebook Messenger can be used to keep in close contact with your friends while maintaining CDC guidelines. 

### 3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
This is especially important because your hands can pick up viral particles from any surfaces they come in contact with, and viruses can more easily enter the body through your face! Because of this, it’s important to avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.

### 4. Practice respiratory hygiene
By coughing and sneezing into one’s elbow or tissue that is immediately disposed of, one can prevent the spread of viruses through droplets.

#### Should I get a Face Mask?
There’s been a lot of debate over whether face masks can help mitigate the spread of coronavirus. According to WHO, healthy people only need to wear a mask if they’re taking care of someone who may have coronavirus. However, if you are coughing or sneezing, you should wear a mask. 

Additionally, if you do choose to wear a mask, it is important to do so properly, or the effects of the mask will be limited. Wash your hands before putting on a mask and regularly while wearing the mask, avoid touching the front of the mask while wearing it or taking it off (and wash your hands if you do so), replace the mask as soon as it is damp, and ensure that your mask is fully covering your mouth and nose without gaps. 

Finally, whether you choose to buy a mask or not, please do not panic buy large quantities of masks! It is unlikely that you will need masks in your daily life, and buying large quantities of masks for your own use may [prevent health workers](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/panic-buying-of-face-masks-is-unwarranted-and-could-pose-risks-for-health-workers-experts-say/2217892/) from having adequate supplies of masks themselves. 

#### When to Self-Isolate
It is recommended to self-isolate for fourteen days (if possible) if you believe you have been directly exposed to coronavirus. The CDC [currently](https://www.northwestern.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/self-isolation/) recommends self-isolation if you are returning from any country under a CDC Warning Level 3, if you have had direct contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, or if you have had direct contact with someone under care for suspected exposure to coronavirus. If you have not had direct contact (e.g. you were at a conference where someone tested positive, but you never interacted with that person), it is not necessary to self-isolate.

If you do choose to self-isolate, it is important to follow proper social distancing and practice self-monitoring as well. Limit contact as much as possible (including with other people living in your residence), and avoid sharing household items if possible. It is also important to keep your surroundings clean, especially those shared with others. Finally, it is [recommended](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/dphs/cdcs/documents/self-quarantine-covid.pdf) to take (and record) your temperature with a thermometer twice a day and watch for signs of a dry cough or difficulty breathing. 

## Caring for Sick Family/Friends
1. Try to stay in a separate room from them if possible - have them self-quarantine to the best of their ability. Encourage them to stay in their room/in the house. If they need medical care, make sure to call their doctor/hospital ahead so they can plan to limit the potential spread. 
2. Good airflow in their room is important! 
3. Using PPE such as masks and gloves is a good thing to do here! 
4. Don't share items such as linens, utensils, etc. with the person who is sick! 
5. If you are caring for someone who lives far away from you, compile their list of emergency contacts (including their doctor/public health department). Help them prepare ahead by having them stock up on the prescriptions they have, fever/anti-inflammatories (particularly acetaminophen), and non-perishable food, and fluids (water and liquids with electrolytes are great)! Check-in on them regularly.
