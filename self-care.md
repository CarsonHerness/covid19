## The Most Important Aspect of Quarantine: You 
Whether you are enjoying the time at home or you are starting to feel anxious, implementing a self-care list or calendar to give yourself and your mind some rest could be beneficial for your mental wellbeing. By incorporating self-care activities into each day now, you will likely set yourself up for a healthy future indoors.

## Start a Routine
First and foremost, set up a daily routine similar to your normal routine. A routine can help you stay healthy (and sane) while you're stuck at home. By maintaining a healthy routine — whether that’s a workout, a healthy meal or making time to relax and reset — can provide a sense of control during a time of uncertainty. This is a perfect moment to rebrand yourself and commit to a healthier lifestyle. 

If you do construct a schedule, I suggest physically writing it down on paper. Or maybe on a dry erase board for easy revisions. But not just on your computer. Post it where everyone can see it. Most importantly, post it where you will notice it every day.

While it may be appealing to join your Zoom classes in your pajamas, it may be more beneficial to act as if you are actually in class (even if you already wear pajamas to class). As more people transition to working from home, one of the most talked-about tips to stay motivated and focused is to simply create “psychological segues”. [Kristen Shockley](https://psychology.uga.edu/directory/people/kristen-shockley), an associate professor of psychology at the University of Georgia encourages establishing “psychological segues” like showering before starting work, getting dressed, or taking a 20-minute coffee break can help you create boundaries between work, school, and time for yourself or others. That way you can make a separation and a determination to start your day right. 

Don’t take this advice from me, the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200312-coronavirus-covid-19-update-work-from-home-in-a-pandemic) and professionals through different mediums have expressed these important tips when working from home: 
* Take a Shower Every Day & Get Dressed for the Day
    * Don’t wake up to the blue hue of your smartphone and immediately start working. Place it across the room, or better yet, in an adjacent one, and force yourself up and out of bed to turn off your alarm each morning. When the alarm does go off, get up and prepare for your day as you would for an office job: take a shower, and get dressed.
* Don’t Sleep Where You Work & Create Boundaries 
    * Don't just grab your laptop and do work from your bed. Set up a desk, your kitchen counter, or your dresser as your new workspace. Only do work from that space. Create boundaries from where you sleep to where you work. This can help separate you from your work. 
* Get Out or Exercise 
    * There are plenty of resources online from Youtube videos to dedicated workout websites to help you find your routine. Find something that works for you indoors to stay active. If you don't have weights or workout equipment, using your own body is enough for a workout. Below I will explain more about how you can stay active. Also, even though some states (like mine in NJ) are on lockdown, you can still sit on your porch or walk outside for a couple minutes (while still practicing social distancing!).
* Communicate Effectively 
    * Make sure that everyone in your home recognizes your boundaries and communicate to them what you're doing. 
* Take breaks & Make Time for Mindfulness
    * Don't overwork yourself. Make sure you take time to meditate, read, or do something other than work. You don't want to overwork yourself.
* When You’re Off From School - Separate Entirely 
    * Don't plug into your schoolwork after you've finished your day. After finishing your school work, make sure you are completely separated from it.

Other tips for sticking to a schedule:
* Don't beat yourself up if you don't get up at the time you intended or forgot to do something. Take your time and be patient. Building a routine and following it takes time. You need to find what works for you. 
* It's okay if your routine switches or there are unexpected disturbances. There are somethings we cannot control, it is best to resume your routine whenever you get the chance. 

Most importantly- have fun! This is your routine, make it unique to your lifestyle.

## Work
Set goals. Make a list of things that need to be tackeld today, this week, and this month. Having a consistent schedule and being strict about it is useful in creating outlines around your time so that you can keep things balanced for both work and play.  

Follow the [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goal approach: Make sure your to-do list for the day includes tasks that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. Use Francesco Cirillo’s [Pomodoro productivity technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) as an effective way to tackle a goal, or even longer projects, by helping you stay focused for 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks in between. Tackle one task within the 25 minutes? Move on to the next. The [TomatoTimer](https://tomato-timer.com/) web application is a simple timer that can help you get started and stay focused.

## Exercise 
If you're not someone who frequently works out or has wanted to start working out but have found commiting to it difficult. Here is some advice from Dani Johnson, a physical therapist at the [Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program](https://healthyliving.mayoclinic.org/), she encourages people who are staying home to get creative. “Every little bit of movement counts,” she said. That's right, you don't need fancy equipment or a lot of time, you just need to find some time to get your heartrate jumping. 

You can start by incorporating movements into moments in your life. If you have back to back online classes, find time to get up and do some squats near your desk. You can do heel raises when you're ashing dishes or side lunges when you're throing clothes in the dryer. 

Stretch it out for at least 30 seconds. Get out and walk (if you're allowed to), even for just 15 minutes. Improvise fancy equipment or household items (a bag of potatos? the whole case of water you just bought?).

## Diet

It may be tempting to eat all your quarantine snacks, but here are some tips to stay healthy, avoid overeating, and learn how to cook. This is a great time to get intimate with your food and feed your body what it most needs; nutrients. 

Before I give some tips, I want to highlight that it is okay if your quaratine diet isn't perfect. Every day you won't make the perfect meal but, practice makes perfect! View this as your "shop your pantry" challenge, try to be creative in what you make and utilize all your resources. Use what you have first, use up fresh food first before resorting to frozen or shelf-stable foods. Finally, priortize what you (and your family) will actually eat. 

According to the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/eat/calories.htm), a healthy eating plan requires:
* Emphasizing vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products
* Include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts
* Limit saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars
* Control portion sizes 

In terms of calories and losing weight, most people need to reduce the number of calorites they get from food and beverages and increase their physical activity. 

For a weight loss of 1–1 ½ pounds per week, daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. In general:
* Eating plans that contain 1,200–1,500 calories each day will help most women lose weight safely.
* Eating plans that contain 1,500–1,800 calories each day are suitable for men and for women who weigh more or who exercise regularly.

Very low calorie diets of fewer than 800 calories per day should not be used unless you are being monitored by your doctor.

If you're interested in tracking your calories or eating habits, here are some helpful apps:
* [My Fitness Pal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)
* [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com/)
* [Calorie Counter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-by-fatsecret/id347184248)

Other tips to keep in mind:
* Do not eat 1-2 hours before going to bed
* Drink enough water and electrolytes
* Don't skip breakfast 
* [Take Omega-3 and Vitamin D Supplements](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-tips#section9) or other supplements to support your immune system
    * [Vitamin D](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is very important for bone health and the proper function of your immune system.
    * [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-guide) reduce inflammation, maintain heart health and promote brain function

If you're worried about finding food during COVID-19, please reach out to your community or schools to see what kinds of options they have in terms of providing food for the community.

## Mental Health
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Learning to cope with stress will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger.

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations.  How you respond to the outbreak can depend on your background, the things that make you different from other people, and  the community you live in. Here are some tips you can do to support yourself. 

### Know the facts &  Put the pandemic in perspective.
Sharing the [facts about COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) and understanding the actual risk to yourself and people you care about can make an outbreak less stressful. When you share accurate information about COVID-19 you can help make people feel less stressed and allow you to connect with them. Check the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) website for the most current information on COVID-19. In addition, make sure you are up to date with your state's current actions.

Limit your exposure to social media and news reports that provide no new information.

### Identify the source(s) of your anxiety.
We are hard-wired for a fight-or-flight response. “The greater the simmering anxiety,” [Dr. Harriet Lerner](https://www.harrietlerner.com/), a psychologist and author, explains, “the more you will see individuals stuck in fighting and blaming on one hand, or distancing and cutting off on the other.” This is normal, she says, but if we can identify our anxiety-driven reactivity, “we can get some distance from it, rather than being propelled into action before we have calmed down enough to do our best thinking.”

Follow the protection and prevention tips given by medical professionals such as the [GCU’s Health Center](https://georgian.edu health-services/), the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](www.cdc.gov), and your own medical doctor.

Acknowledge your reactions. Allow yourself time to reflect on what you are feeling and how you may be reacting to any fears and uncertainties of the future.

### Refrain from shaming and blaming.
When survival anxiety is high and goods feel scarce, it’s easy to blame or scapegoat others, forgetting that we are all in this together. “Our target may be a particular group or an individual, like the woman who sneezes in line in front of us,” Dr. Lerner says, “which leads to a lack of recognition that humans are more alike than different.”

Avoid generalizing that anyone who is sick potentially has the coronavirus. Examine any irrational or rigid thoughts that can exist when there is uncertainty.

Practice calming rituals: Stay grounded in the present moment, which can help you maintain an internal sense of stability and balance when outside events feel threatening

### Don’t be afraid to ask for help.
Now is the time to turn toward each other. “We are here to help each other out,” Dr. Lerner reminds us, “so avoid being a do-it-yourselfer when you’re not qualified. Seek supports and use campus resources. Reach out to friends and family and learn about campus resources available. If you or someone you know has high distress that does not seem to be lessening, talk about it with others or contact the your school's counseling center.

Here are other resources if you need any help: 
* [Virus Anxiety](https://www.virusanxiety.com/) by Shine Text - a toolkit of free resources for anxiety and your mental health. Includes mantras, guided meditations, and articles.
* [Calm App](https://blog.calm.com/take-a-deep-breath) - free content from the Calm app to support your mental and emotional wellness.
* [Mental Health Hotline](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/immediate-help) 

### Don’t procrastinate about preparing for the worst.
Anxiety, Dr. Lerner says, can push us to under- or overreact: “So we either engage in compulsive hand washing or we do the opposite and act like the germ theory doesn’t apply to us.” And this anxiety, she says, will mount if we postpone or ignore expert counsel: “Passivity and inaction will make fear grow.” So, instead of giving up and saying, “I can’t keep my hands off my face,” Dr. Lerner suggests we trust our capacity to make necessary changes, recognize where we have agency and take common sense, precautionary measures now. “If you haven’t done your best to get a couple of extra weeks’ supply of food or medication, do it today. If you feel frozen, ask a buddy to push you to act and help you make wise decisions about how much you need of what.”

### Connect, connect, connect.
Social distancing and mandates to shelter in place may require us to stay in our homes, but that doesn’t mean we have to isolate. Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling. Join online conferences, socials, FaceTime your friends or family, create Zoom hangouts, or play online games with others. There are many ways to connect. 

Here are some ways to connect with your friends: 
* [Netflix Party Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-party/oocalimimngaihdkbihfgmpkcpnmlaoa?hl=en)
* [Play Club Penguin](https://cponline.pw/)

### Practice self-compassion.
This moment calls on us to not only care for others but to also be gentle with ourselves. “Anxiety and fear,” Dr. Lerner reminds us, “are physiological processes that cavort and careen through our bodies and make us miserable. They will subside, only to return again; they will arrive uninvited for as long as we live. So don’t be hard on yourself when you can’t shut yourself off from fear and pain — your own and the world’s. Fear isn’t fun, but it signals that we are fully human.”

### Don’t skip the self-care.
Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and avoid alcohol and drugs. Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy. Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.

Finally, don’t let fear and anxiety become pandemics, too.
