How do you work and study from home, when many of the learning mechanisms we've developed at school depend on learning in person with professors and peers?

This section focuses on doing work and school from home, so if you're looking for other online learning opportunities, check out [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link education.md %}). 

## Create a schedule
While stuck at home for days on end, it’s easy for the hours, days, and weeks to blend together. Many of the structures on college campuses that create a schedule are no longer part of your daily life, such as the dining hall hours, fixed class meeting times, and fixed tutoring office hours. To mimic this structure, create a schedule that includes everything from meal and homework time to breaks and social time.

### Example schedule

| Time            | Task                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------|
| 8-8:30 AM       | Go for a run (safe social distancing!)      |
| 8:30-9:30 AM    | Shower, coffee, go through emails/messages  |
| 9:30-11 AM      | Work on Algorithms homework                 |
| 11-11:30 AM     | Computer Systems office hours               |
| 11:30 AM - 1 PM | Lunch/break while Zooming friends           |
| 1-2 PM          | Class project meeting                       |
| 2-3 PM          | Research group meeting                      |             
| 3-4 PM          | Work on Computer Music homework             |
| 4-4:30 PM       | Break                                       |
| 4:30-6 PM       | Economics class                             |
| 6-7:30 PM       | Dinner with family                          |
| 7:30 PM-9 PM    | Homework time                               |
| 9-11 PM         | Free time/self care                         |

Your schedule doesn’t need to be this fixed/detailed, or it can be more if you want it! The important thing is to create some kind of schedule to follow. Write it down somewhere (publicly in your home or privately), and/or put it into a digital calendar such as Google Calendar.

## Create physical and mental boundaries
The goal here is to help your brain distinguish between “work time” and “life time.” On a residential campus, these boundaries are built in, by moving from your dorm room to class to the dining hall to the library. Since all of these spaces are now in one place, you’ll need to artificially create these spaces.

If possible, set aside a different area to do work. For example, designate a corner of your room for homework, and only use that space during “work hours.” If that’s not possible, try to give your brain other indicators of moving from “work” to “life,” for example by closing your computer or the tabs/programs you were using for work. Try to limit family/friend interactions during set work times, and don’t work in places with the television on in the background. If you are living with other people who are working from home, perhaps work in a similar area if being around others doing work helps you focus. 

Other tips: 
* Avoid “procrastin-eating” by setting up your workspace away from the fridge or pantry.
* Block access to social media and don’t have shows/movies running in the background during work hours
* Change into “work clothes” instead of staying in pajamas during work hours to help create another boundary between “work” and “life.”
* Limit responding to messages, texts, and emails to scheduled times, since 
    * However, also be responsive to communications, since this can help fight feelings of loneliness
* Give yourself some slack--this will be a difficult transition, and it will take time to figure out what works for you.

## Task management
If you already had a task management system (such as a planner) that was working, keep on using it! If your old system isn’t working as well anymore (or if you didn’t have one…), here’s some suggestions to try out:
* [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)
* [Google Tasks](https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) (has great integration with Google Calendar)
* Other suggestions [here](https://blog.capterra.com/free-task-management-software/)

## Time management
Time management is a whole new beast when working from home! With all of the distractions of home, it can be easy to use your time poorly. Try out these systems to see where your time is going, which can help you figure out when you’re most and least productive during the day.

Also utilize timers, with scheduled breaks. Setting aside the next 25 minutes for work, followed by a 5 minute break, can help your brain focus on the task at hand.

## Help yourself focus
Try out some new focus apps, like Tide or Calm. If you can't focus due to concerns about COVID-19, reach out to friends or family and talk it through with them. Otherwise consider downloading the meditation app Headspace. Headspace has recently created new meditation packages in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Take care of your physical and mental health
You won’t be able to work if you’re letting your health deteriorate. Check out the [Self Care page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link self-care.md %}) for more tips on creating a routine, maintaining your mental health, and more!
