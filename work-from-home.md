How do you work and study from home, when many of the learning mechanisms we've developed at school depend on learning in person with professors and peers?

## Getting Started
Check out this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/smarter-living/how-to-work-from-home-if-youve-never-done-it-before.html) from the New York Times on working from home, from a writer who has been working from home for years before the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Create Physical and Mental Boundaries
If possible, set aside a different area to do work. For example, designate a corner of your room for homework, and only use that space during "work hours."
